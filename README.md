Hi,

This is my first working project following the Odin Project foundations course.

The aim was to recreate a version of the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. 

I had followed some tutorials in the past but they never really stuck. This is the only course I have found that gives a decent explanation of how things work. It also allowed me allowed me to follow my intuition and become more confident in researching when I am stuck.   

I am proud of this page, imperfections and all. 

In time, I will work on the media query differences and putting the voice search button on the right of the search bar but in all, I think it's a pretty good stab at something I have been working on part time to my full time job and other commitments. 

If I was to start again, I would step away from the code editor and chrome console and actually study the flow of the page, what does each section do, what is linked and why it must react this way for the user. 

This page may change over time as I learn and use this page a testing site for my ideas.

Now onto Javascript fundamentals and Rock Paper Scissors. :)

Thanks,
Indigorose
